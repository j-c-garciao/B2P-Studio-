# B2P Studio

B2P Studio is demonstrative tool for assessing Building Evacuation Route Planning as Process-Network Synthesis Problems via [P-graphs](https://p-graph.org/). 

B2P Studio is a Java-based user-friendly computer program that allows the evaluation of building evacuation route plans. B2P Studio relies on (i) modeling building floor maps by adopting the conventional graph notation; and, (ii) assessing the evacuation route via the P-graph framework. An B2P Studio model is a directed graph consisting of a set of nodes connected by arcs. The nodes represent the potential locations of evacuates and other areas, e.g., rooms, corridors, safe areas, stairs, or intersections, on a building-floor map. The arcs represent the potential movements between the locations, though k, e.g., passages, gates, or doorways. B2P studio exhaustively identifies optimal evacuation plans for user defined building by searching every feasible evacuation route; and, then computing the optimal plan of it.

B2P Studio is an open source project released under the [Simplified BSD](https://github.com/j-c-garciao/B2P_Studio/LICENSE) license.
